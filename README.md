# Night Demons

Night Demons (name in progress) is a Minecraft
adaptation of Blood on the Clocktower, a social
deduction game for 5 or more players.

### Baseline

- This version should have a good number of roles
from the original game.
- A storyteller is assigned before the game starts.
- Then, the storyteller assigns players their roles.
- Every night, the demon chooses a player to kill.
- In the day, players can nominate other players for
execution.  Each nomination is put to a vote.  The
nominee can be executed with a majority vote.
- Each player can view the entire list of roles at
any time.

### Possible Modifications

- No storyteller.  It would be nice if everyone got to
participate as a character.
